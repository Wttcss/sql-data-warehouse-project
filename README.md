# üèõÔ∏è The SQL Data Warehouse Project: Blueprint for Insight

## Overview
This repository chronicles the end-to-end development of a modern, high-performance **data warehouse** built on **SQL Server**. The project covers the full data lifecycle, from raw source extraction to actionable business intelligence.

## üöÄ Key Objectives & Features
* **Robust ETL Pipeline:** Designing and implementing reliable Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) processes to ingest data from various sources into a staging environment.
* **Dimensional Modeling:** Applying best practices in data modeling (Star Schema) to optimize the warehouse for query performance and reporting ease.
* **Core Data Elements:** Focusing on key business metrics ( Sales, Inventory, Customer Behavior).
* **Advanced Analytics:** Developing analytical queries, views, and potentially OLAP cubes (if applicable) to unlock deep business insights.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
* **Database:** SQL Server (specify version if needed, 2021/Azure SQL)
* **ETL Tooling:** (Specify tool,SSIS / Azure Data Factory / Python/Airflow Scripts)
* **Modeling:** Kimball-style Dimensional Modeling
* **Visualization:** (Specify tool,  Power BI / Tableau)

## Project Structure
* `/sql`: Contains DDL (CREATE TABLE) and DML (Stored Procedures/ETL scripts) for the database.
* `/etl`: Scripts and configuration files related to the ETL process.
* `/docs`: Data dictionary, ERDs, and design documents.
* `/analytics`: Advanced reporting views and analytical queries.
